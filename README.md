# Panic! at the Discord[^1]

## Concept & Personal Connection

### Personal Experience
*Panic! at the Discord* draws directly from my personal experience of participting in a high school Discord server with close friends: a space that was initially created for gaming but evolved into something far more meaningful. What started as a hub for playing games like *Among Us* together quickly became a vibrant community where we shared memes, debated silly topics, posted embarrassing photos, and supported each other through life’s ups and downs. It wasn’t just about gaming anymore; it was a place where humor reigned supreme, inside jokes flourished, and meaningful connections were forged.

However, as college approached, priorities shifted. Homework piles grew taller, deadlines loomed larger, and real-life responsibilities began to overshadow our online antics. Messages became fewer and farther between, until one day, the server went silent. Looking back, I feel a mix of nostalgia and sadness about how something so integral to our teenage years could fade away without us even realizing it. This bittersweet memory forms the emotional core of the game: the tension between staying connected online and navigating the demands of adulthood.

The game reflects this journey by alternating between two phases: one focused on the playful chaos of Discord interactions and another centered on balancing real-life obligations with maintaining those digital friendships. Through its mechanics, *Panic! at the Discord* captures the joy of sharing laughter in a group chat, the frustration of feeling overwhelmed by external pressures, and the regretful realization that sometimes, no matter how hard you try, people grow apart. By simulating these dynamics, the game invites players to reflect on their own experiences with online communities and the inevitable changes that come with growing up.
